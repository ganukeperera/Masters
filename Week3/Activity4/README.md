This project demonstrate an OOP application using SQLite3 to manage a simple application with college designed in Week 3.

The database includes 3 entities including students, teachers and courses. Each table have multiple features which are listed in ER diagram. The application connects to SQLite3 database, inserts sample records (5 students, 3 teachers and 3 courses), and perform SQL queries to retrieve the number of students for MSE800 course and list all teachers name who are teaching MSE801. I have added inline comments for more clarity.
