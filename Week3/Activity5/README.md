This application is written for a private clinic to store and retrieve information about clinic's doctors and patients.

I have used Python and SQLite3 to develop this system. The database of the application has two entities including doctor and patient. These tables have certain features that depict in ER diagram. Database has some sample data included to verify the application's use cases (5 sample records in each table). I have written sql queries to retrieve patients whose age is greater than 65 and doctor who is specialized in psychology.
